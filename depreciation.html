            <h1>Depreciation of www.gunner.online</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="text pageText">
            <p><i>This post was originally written on my personal website, and can be viewed <a href="https://beta.sebg.uk/blog/2019/08/05/www-gunner-online-depreciation">here</a></i>
            <p>
            This is a notice that pages currently present on www.gunner.online are being slowly migrated over to new locations.
            </p><p>
            The current depreciation plan is as follows (please note, this is subject to change):<ol>
            <li>Installation of notice on homepage at www.gunner.online informing of the planned depreciation</li>
            <li>Moving and accordingly modifying code to ensure functionality to a new domain.</li>
            <li>Installation of a notice on the webpage hosted at www.gunner.online, informing of the new location of the site and the changeover date.</li>
            <li>All visitors to the page hosted at www.gunner.online will be redirected to the corresponding new page.</li>
            <li>A period of time in which Google Analytics data will be monitored to ensure there is no remaining legitimate traffic to the www.gunner.online domain or corresponding subdomains.</li>
            <li>The www.gunner.online domain and any other subdomains may be repurposed (as is the case with scripts.gunner.online, as it now serves as a general purpose hosting location for JavaScript files for other projects)</li>
            </ol>
            </p><p>
            As visitors to my first public website, www.gunner.online, may have noticed, that site has remained by and large untouched since the end of 2017, with the GitHub repo only recieving small maintentance commits since then.
            </p><p>
            This was due, in no small part, due to my having to re-allocate a vast amount of the time spent coding in 2017/18 to my actual academic studies for my A level exams in the summer of 2018. However, as with all hobbies, it's very difficult to let it go completely, and I'd had in the back of my mind to start learning a server side language, as this seemed (to me at the time!) to be the most straightforward solution to simple issues like having a consistent menubar across all pages in the website (implemented using document.write and clientside javascript on www.gunner.online) - this was before I knew of the existence of things like Jekyll!
            </p><p>
            Consequently, due to the low initial learning barrier to entry, and similarity to JavaScript in many ways, I started investigating PHP, and installed it on my local web environment on my laptop. So far, so good - I was tinkering with PHP in my reduced spare time in the lead up to exams, and ready to take on a proper project - initially I'd intended to update the www.gunner.online site, but there was one small issue - it was hosted via GitHub Pages, which only supports static sites (i.e. not PHP!).
            </p><p>
            After my studies were over, I instead decided to update my internal based website instead, as I had the hardware (a Raspberry Pi) to host a PHP based website. Eventually I did invest in a VPS from DigitalOcean, but at this point I had other projects I was persuing, so updating www.gunner.online got put onto the backburner.
            </p><p>
            The issue now is that due to the fact that it has been over 3 years since I started designing and coding www.gunner.online, I have completely forgotten the way in which I originally designed the site - indeed when I tried to even re-familiarising myself with my old CSS class names and conflicting rules for posting this update on the site I found it incredibly frustrating! An additional irritation was my decision to explicitly host CSS and JS files on separate subdomains, making an offline development environment very frustrating to manufacture.
            </p><p>
            Consequently, I have decided to migrate all the pages on www.gunner.online to new homes - primarily on my personal website <a href="https://sebg.uk">sebastian.gunner.co.uk</a>, where I don't have to worry about building a site with all the corresponding infrastructure from the ground up, but rather just by importing the raw HTML and JS and tweaking the styling to fit.
            </p><p>
            I have no immediate plans for the gunner.online, but some subdomains will remain intact - I have already repurposed a part of scripts.gunner.online for hosting some scripts that I use on multiple websites (and don't wish to change on each one individually!), and assets.gunner.online/resources.gunner.online has already been moved to an Amazon S3 bucket in anticipation of domain-agnostic (i.e. not tied to an existing project domain) image or video hosting.
            </p><p>
            I will detail the pages thusfar migrated and their new locations in a table below, which I will endeavour to keep updated through the depreciation process. Any pages not yet migrated will have ~ as the New location.
            </p><p>
